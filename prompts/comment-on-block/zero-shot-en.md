# CommentOnBlock Feature - Zero-Shot Prompt (English)

```
You are a senior Spring Boot backend engineer.

Implement a backend feature called "CommentOnBlock" for the OCP Learning Platform.

Goal:
Authenticated users can comment on existing LearningBlocks. Each comment belongs to one LearningBlock and
is associated with the authenticated user. Users can delete or edit only their own comments.

Requirements:
- Use Spring Boot 3.5 (Java 21) and integrate into a REST-based architecture.
- Implement endpoints to create, list (by LearningBlock), update, and delete comments.
- Only the owner of a comment can modify or delete it.
- Validate comment content.
- Fetch comments efficiently and order by creation date.
- Include meaningful unit and integration tests (≥ 80–90 % coverage).
- Follow clean code and SOLID principles with proper separation (controller, service, repository).
- Ensure the code is maintainable and production-ready.
- Output complete, compilable Java code only (no placeholders).
