# LearningBlock Feature - Zero-Shot Prompt (English)

```
You are a senior Spring Boot backend engineer.

Implement a backend feature called "LearningBlocks" for the OCP Learning Platform.

Goal:
Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete LearningBlocks that contain Markdown content
describing their learning progress or certification experiences. Non-owners must respect visibility rules.

Requirements:
- Use Spring Boot 3.5 (Java 21) and integrate into a REST-based architecture.
- Implement full CRUD for LearningBlocks.
- Enforce ownership: users can modify/delete only their own blocks; visibility controls reading (PRIVATE/PUBLIC).
- Include pagination and sorting for listing.
- Provide meaningful unit and integration tests targeting 80–90% coverage.
- Ensure clean, maintainable code with a layered design (controller/service/persistence) and proper error handling.
- Produce complete, compilable Java code only (no placeholders).
- we want to have a coverage between 80-90%
